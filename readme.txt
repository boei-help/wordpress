= Why you should stop using Live Chat =

None of my friends like to use live chat because:

1. Sometimes you don't get a reply
1. You have to keep the tab with the chat open
1. Sometimes you get a reply but you forgot to open the tab and the agent is already gone again

Why are we forcing customers to use something new? We already have great communication channels!

I'm working on Boei to help resolve this issue. I don't want to give customers live chat only, but also WhatsApp, Twitter DMs, Facebook messenger, and other options. I want to provide support to my customers on the channels that they already use, build a relationship instead of being a live chat robot.
